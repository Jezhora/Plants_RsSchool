# Plants_RsSchool
My first project within the Rsschool course. When I first wrote 'Hello World'. 
Unfortunately, I fell ill with covid and could not complete the task on time. 
But a few months later I returned to him.

TASK

Part 1

You need to layout the page according to the layout - Desktop only
The 1440px content width should not change when the browser window is resized.

Part 2

In this part of the task, we adapt the previously made-up page for tablets and mobile devices.
At resolutions of 768px (tablet) and 380px (mobile), the task is to match the layout with the layout - Tablet and Mobile.
On other resolutions up to 320px inclusive, it is enough to ensure the absence of a horizontal scroll bar while maintaining the entire content of the page.
Also at this stage, we add an adaptive menu to the layout, to create which we use js. The layout lacks the design of an open (active) burger menu, so we make it to our taste, preferably in the layout design style.

Part 3

When you click on the buttons: Gardens, Lawn, Planting, the focus changes to services in the service section.
Accordion in the prices section which will include 3 dropdown lists about services and prices.
In the contacts section, implement a select with a choice of cities. Depending on the user's choice, a block appears with the address and phone number of the office in a particular city.
